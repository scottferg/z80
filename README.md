# Z80 - A GameBoy Z80 emulator written in Go

This version of the z80 package implements a Sharp LR35902 emulator, the CPU found in the GameBoy. 
If you are looking for a traditional Z80, you will want to use the [main fork](https://github.com/remogatto/z80) of this repo. The CPU
emulation code is generated using a modified version of the
<tt>z80.pl</tt> script shipped with
[FUSE](http://fuse-emulator.sourceforge.net/). The script has been
hacked to generate Go code rather than C code.

# Features

* Machine independent (i.e. the same package could be used to emulate
  several Z80-based machines).
* Tested against the excellent test-suite shipped with FUSE.
* It includes a couple of disassembling/debugging functions.

# Emulators

The z80 package is at the core of a couple of emulator written in
Go. Namely:

* [GoSpeccy](https://github.com/remogatto/gospeccy) - A Spectrum ZX 48k Emulator
* [SMS](https://github.com/remogatto/sms) - A Sega Master System Emulator
* [TRS80](https://github.com/lkesteloot/trs80) - A TRS-80 Model III Emulator
